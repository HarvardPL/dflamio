\begin{abstract}
We present a natural application of the FLAM authorization logic: A programming language with dynamic information-flow control. The language is constructed by instantiating the abstract label model of LIO with the model offered by FLAM. The resulting system, FLAMIO, has provably strong confidentiality and integrity guarantees, and allows for a straightforward extension of LIO that supports distributed computation. Specifically, we extend FLAMIO with remote procedure calls, which in turn can be used to implement the distributed part of the authorization logic of FLAM. We have implemented \lang and shown that it enforces a strong notion of noninterference. We also present several case studies demonstrating the usefulness of having dynamic information-flow in a distributed setting with mutual distrust.
