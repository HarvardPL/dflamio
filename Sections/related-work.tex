The FLAM technical report \cite{flamtr} presents a security typed language $\mathsf{F}\lambda$ in which policies are FLAM principals. Much like \lang{} $\mathsf{F}\lambda$ can delegate trust during evaluation and allows querying of trust relationships. However, the decision of whether or not to allow downgrading (ie., adding new trust relationships) must be performed statically using a relatively simple type system. In \lang{} all decisions about whether to allow downgrading is done during evaluation, meaning that \lang{} can potentially allow more downgrading and remain secure.

FLAC \cite{7536372} is a calculus for flow-limited authorization. \TODO{Bla bla bla}
