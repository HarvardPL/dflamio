Before discussing how FLAM and LIO combines in a uniform way, we briefly introduce each system separately. We first highlight the important parts of FLAM necessary for this work, and details can be found in \cite{Arden:2015:FA:2859845.2859998}. Similarly, we highlight the important parts of LIO, and additional details can be found in \cite{SRMMlio}.

\subsection{The FLAM principal lattice}
Figure~\ref{fig:flam-syntax} describes the syntax of FLAM principals. The grammar is parametric in a set $\Nameset$ of names representing principals like $\mathsf{Alice}$ and $\mathsf{Bob}$. Given a principal $p$ FLAM gives the ability to talk about the confidentiality and integrity of $p$ using \emph{basis projections} $\conf{p}$ and $\integ{p}$ respectively. The principal $\conf{p}$ represents the authority to learn anything that $p$ can learn, and $\integ{p}$ represents the authority to modify anything that $p$ can modify. Given principals $p$ and $q$ FLAM can also represent the authority of \emph{both} $p$ and $q$ as $p \conj q$ or the authority of \emph{either} $p$ or $q$ as $p \disj q$. This forms a lattice $(\mathcal{P}, \actsfor)$ with the partial ordering $\actsfor$ (pronounced ``acts for''\footnote{The relation $p \actsfor q$ can also be interpreted as ``$q$ trusts $p$'', which may sometimes be helpful for intuition.}), where $\bot$ and $\top$ represents the least and most trusted principals respectively, and where the elements is given by the grammar in Figure~\ref{fig:flam-syntax}. We denote the set of principals by $\mathcal{P}$.\footnote{Formally, the elements in the lattice is the equivalence class of $\mathcal{P}$ modulo the relation $\equiv$ where $a \equiv b \iff a \actsfor b \wedge b \actsfor a$.}.

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Syntax of FLAM}

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Ownership projections}
Besides basis projections $\rightarrow$ and $\leftarrow$ FLAM also defines \emph{ownership projections} $\owner{p}{q}$ representing the principal $q$, but where the owner $p$ controls which principals $\owner{p}{q}$ should trust. To see how ownership projections increase the expressiveness of FLAM, imagine we represent the fact that $\mathsf{Bob}$ is an employee at $\mathsf{Acme}$ by the delegation $\mathsf{Bob}$ $\actsfor$ $\mathsf{Emp}$. This may seems fine, but there's a big problem: Now $\mathsf{Bob}$ can add new employees by delegating to new principals. For instance if Alice $\actsfor$ $\mathsf{Bob}$ it follows by transitivity that Alice $\actsfor$ $\mathsf{Emp}$! Instead, we represent the fact that $\mathsf{Bob}$ is an employee of $\mathsf{Acme}$ as $\owner{\mathsf{Acme}}{\mathsf{Bob}}$ $\actsfor$ $\mathsf{Emp}$. Since $\mathsf{Acme}$ controls which principals $\owner{\mathsf{Acme}}{\mathsf{Bob}}$ delegate to $\mathsf{Bob}$ can no longer add employees by delegating to them.

\paragraph{An information-flow ordering}
An important distinction between FLAM and other authorization models is that FLAM unifies trust and information-flow into a single concept. Specifically, FLAM defines the operations
\begin{align*}
p \flowsto q &\circeq \conf{q} \conj \integ{p} \actsfor \conf{p} \conj \integ{q}\\
p \join q &\circeq \conf{(p \conj q)} \conj \integ{(p \disj q)} \\
p \meet q &\circeq \conf{(p \disj q)} \conj \integ{(p \conj q)}
\end{align*}
and this forms a lattice $(\mathcal{P}, \flowsto)$ with the partial ordering $\flowsto$ and the bottom element $\bot^{\flowsto} \circeq \conf{\bot} \conj \integ{\top}$ representing the least confidential and most trusted principal, and the top element $\top^{\flowsto} \circeq \conf{\top} \conj \integ{\bot}$ representing the most confidential and least trusted principal\footnote{Like for the lattice representing trust, the elements in the information-flow lattice is equivalence classes of $\mathcal{P}$ modulo the relation $\equiv$ defined as $a \equiv b \iff a \flowsto b \wedge b \flowsto a$.}.

\paragraph{Voice of a principal}
Finally, FLAM defines the \emph{voice} of a principal $p$, denoted $\voice{p}$, as the minimum integrity needed to influence the flow of information labeled $p$. Formally, the voice operation is defined for principals in normal form\footnote{In \cite{Arden:2015:FA:2859845.2859998} the authors show how any FLAM principal $p$ can be factored into a conjunction of a confidentiality projection $\conf{q}$ and an integrity projection $\integ{r}$. This is called the normal form of $p$.} $\conf{p} \conj \integ{q}$ as $\voice{\conf{p} \conj \integ{q}} = \integ{p} \conj \integ{q}$.

\subsection{Coarse-grained information flow using LIO.}
LIO \cite{SRMMlio} is a Haskell library for dynamic information-flow control. LIO is parametric in the label model and takes a coarse-grained approach to information-flow using a \emph{floating label model}: Instead of attaching a label to each value in the program, the \emph{computational context} is protected with a label called the current label. Throughout the execution of the program this label will ``climb'' up the information-flow lattice until it is required to climb above the \emph{clearance level} of the program, at which the program aborts. The type of LIO computations form a monad \cite{Wadler:1995:MFP:647698.734146}, which makes programming with LIO convenient in Haskell. Specifically, the operations $\return{\expr}$ embeds a pure expression $\expr$ into the LIO computational context, and the operation $\bind{\expr_1}{\expr_2}$ (pronounced ``bind'') chains together monadic LIO operations $\expr_1$ and $\expr_2$.

\paragraph{Labeled values}
As LIO protects every value in the computational context by a single label $\level_{\mathsf{cur}}$, it must provide a way to protect some values with a label higher than $\level_{\mathsf{cur}}$ (ie., a value representing a password should not be protected merely by $\level_{\mathsf{cur}}$ since it should not be observable to an attacker). To do this, LIO provides two useful operations:
\begin{minted}{haskell}
label :: Label l => a -> l -> LIO l (Labeled l a)
unlabel :: Label l => Labeled l a -> LIO l a
\end{minted}
Here, \mintinline{haskell}{Label l} is a typeclass constraint specifying that the type \mintinline{haskell}{l} must be an instance of the \mintinline{haskell}{Label} typeclass, meaning that \mintinline{haskell}{l} must have operations $\join$, $\meet$ and $\flowsto$. The operation \mintinline{haskell}{label} takes an expression $\expr$ and a label $\level$, and protects $\expr$ with the label $\level$. This labeled value can then be passed around without raising the label of the computational context. When the value is needed, the operation \mintinline{haskell}{unlabel} must be invoked, which gets back the value and raises the current label $\level_{\mathsf{cur}}$ to $\level_{\mathsf{cur}} \join \level$, while checking that the new current label flows to the clearance label $\level_{\mathsf{clr}}$ of the application.

\paragraph{Preventing label creep}
As the program executes and performs \mintinline{haskell}{unlabel} operations, the current label will continue to rise. For instance, imagine adding two labeled numbers together:
\begin{minted}{haskell}
add :: (Num a, Label l) => Labeled l a ->
         Labeled l a -> LIO l a
add lx ly = unlabel lx >>= \x ->
            unlabel ly >>= \y ->
            return (x + y)
\end{minted}
Evaluating \mintinline{haskell}{add x y} will raise the current label $\level_{\mathsf{cur}}$ to $\level_{\mathsf{cur}} \join \level_x \join \level_y$, where $\level_x$ and $\level_y$ represent the labels on the values of $x$ and $y$ respectively. To avoid this \emph{label creep} LIO introduces the following operation:
\begin{minted}{haskell}
toLabeled :: Label l => l -> LIO l ->
               LIO l (Labeled l a)
\end{minted}
The expression \mintinline{haskell}{toLabeled l m} evaluates \texttt{m} and resets the current label to its state before the evaluation of \texttt{m}. To remain secure, the result is labeled with the label \texttt{l} and LIO checks that the evaluation of \texttt{m} never raised the current label above \texttt{l}.
