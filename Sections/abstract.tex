The Flow-Limited Authorization Model (FLAM) is an expressive security model that unifies trust and information-flow into a single principal lattice. Previous programming languages for security building on top of FLAM has focused on statically verifying fine-grained information-flow control.
We take a different approach and show that FLAM fits cleanly into a coarse-grained information-flow setting in the style of Labeled IO (LIO) by designing a new language \lang{} that combines the two systems. The FLAM proof search for establishing trust is performed inside protected computational contexts provided by LIO, ensuring that authorization checking does not reveal confidential information to attackers. Using FLAM as the principal lattice for LIO we show how LIO can be extended to a distributed setting, where nodes communicate through remote procedure calls (RPCs), and how the FLAM rule for proving distributed trust can be implemented using the same RPC mechanism. We have implemented \lang{} as a Haskell library and proved that it enforces a strong notion of noninterference. We also present several case studies demonstrating the usefulness of coarse-grained dynamic information-flow in a distributed setting with mutual distrust.
