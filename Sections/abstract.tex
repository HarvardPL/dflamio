We present a natural application of the FLAM authorization logic: A programming language with coarse-grained dynamic information-flow control. The language is constructed by instantiating the abstract label model of LIO with the FLAM principal lattice. The resulting system, \lang, has provably strong confidentiality and integrity guarantees, and allows for a straightforward extension of LIO that supports distributed computation. Specifically use remote procedure calls to implement the distributed part of the authorization logic of FLAM. We have implemented \lang{} as a Haskell library and shown that it enforces a strong notion of noninterference. We also present several case studies demonstrating the usefulness of having coarse-grained dynamic information-flow in a distributed setting with mutual distrust.
